## Meta U Requirements

### Go beyond CodePath, Difficult/ Ambiguous Technical Problems (atleast 2)

* Your app provides multiple opportunities for you to overcome difficult/ambiguous technical problems (more below)
  * Combine information from three different APIs (movies, music, books) into a single data model.
  * Cache API data for offline use.

### SDK & Database Integration

* Your app interacts with a database (e.g. Parse) 
  * Project will use Parse for Users & Reviews.
* Your app integrates with at least one SDK (e.g. Google Maps SDK, Facebook SDK) or API (that you didnâ€™t learn about in CodePath).
  * Project will use three APIs, one for each media type.

### User Authentication

* You can log in/log out of your app as a user
* You can sign up with a new user profile
* Your app has multiple views

### Visuals & Interactions

* Your app uses at least one gesture (e.g. double tap to like, e.g. pinch to scale) 
  * Can implement to double tap to 'thumbs-up' a review.
* Your app incorporates at least one external library to add visual polish
  * Haven't done research on this yet but I should be able to use Material Design.
* Your app uses at least one animation (e.g. fade in/out, e.g. animating a view growing and shrinking)
  * Maybe an animation for a logo on a launch screen.
